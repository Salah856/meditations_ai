<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><b>Meditations AI</b> is an ongoing proof of concept project. The objective is simply to learn more about NLP, text generation, and philosophy whilst experimenting with different ML architectures to produce something cool. The something really cool will be an algorithm based Stoic philosopher.</p>
<br>
<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>At the moment our Stoic philosopher has read very few philosophical texts, limiting themselves to The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and Epistulae Morales Ad Lucilium (Moral Letters to Lucilius) by Seneca. Ofcourse any well to do philosopher would never think of limiting themselves to so little. Therefore, next steps are to widen this foundation of knowledge. I have written a couple of articles about the project:</p>

	<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/recurrent-ensemble-learning-caffdcd94092">Supercharged Prediction with Ensemble Learning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please feel free to learn more about the building process through these articles!</p>
<br>
<p>For now, please read our first draft of Stoic philosophy <a href="./works/meditations.md">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>We are currently looking at different network architectures and better ways to rate our ensemble of RNN models. We are also looking further afield at other Stoic texts (recommendations are very welcome!).</p>
