<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><b>Meditations AI</b> is an ongoing proof of concept project. The objective is simply to learn more about NLP, text generation, and philosophy whilst experimenting with different ML architectures to produce something cool. The something really cool will be an algorithm based Stoic philosopher.</p>
<br>
<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>At the moment our Stoic philosopher has read very few philosophical texts, limiting themselves to The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Ofcourse any well to do philosopher would never think of limiting themselves to so little. Therefore, next steps are to widen this foundation of knowledge. I have written an <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/stoic-philosophy-built-by-algorithms-9cff7b91dcbdss">article</a> about our first steps into Stoic philosophy, please feel free to learn more about the building process there.</p>
<br>
<p>For now, please read our first draft of Stoic philosophy <a href="./works/meditations.md">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>We are currently researching Epistulae Morales Ad Lucilium, otherwise known as Moral Letters to Lucilius, Moral Epistles, or Letters from a Stoic. These are a collection of 124 letters written by Seneca to his friend Lucilius. In the letter Seneca gives advice to Lucilius on how to better himself as a Stoic.
